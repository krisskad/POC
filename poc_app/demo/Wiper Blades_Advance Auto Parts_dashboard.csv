Lift the wiper arm away from the rear window until it locks in an outward position. If it doesn\'t lock, hold the arm away from the window while you complete this task. Remove the blade by turning it at a right angle to the wiper blade arm. Press the plastic tabs together in order to slide the blade out of the j-hook that holds the blade in place. On some vehicles, there is a button instead of tabs. Press the button to allow the blade to be released from the wiper arm. Slide the new blade into the wiper arm, making sure that it properly locks into place. Return the wiper arm carefully to the rear window. Wet the glass and test the wiper to make sure it is attached securely. 0 0\nASK A QUESTION\nRECENTLY VIEWED AND RELATED ITEMS\n$21.99\nTRICO Truck\nBeam Wiper Blade, 20 Inch\n$18.49\n(5)\nXtraClear\nStandard Beam Wiper Blade, 26 Inch\n$63.99\nBosch\nOE Premium Conventional Wiper Blade Set, 23 Inch and 20 Inch', 'Z7� is an infused micro-metric synthetic compound in the rubber, specifically engineered for maximum wear resistance resulting in three times longer life\nMade in the USA\nRobust superstructure built for durable all-weather performance\nSWIFT� Easy Connection Technology adaptor system allows for easy install\nMemory Curve Steel� beam provides a solid base for uniform pressure for the clearest wipe\nVortec� aerofoil design converts wind force for maximum windshield contact\nLaser-precision twin rail design provides increased uniform pressure across entire length of blade for a streak-free wipe', 'Brake Pads & Shoes\nBrake Rotors\nAlternators\nWater Pumps\nShow All', 'Ford Parts\nChevrolet Parts\nHonda Parts\nDodge Parts\nShow All', 'Spark Plugs\nCar Batteries\nOil Filters\nMotor Oil\nShow All', 'Manufacturer Brand\nVehicle Make / Model\nPerformance Parts\nLawn & Garden\nBoating & Marine\nMotorcycle & ATV', '', '', 'Accessibility Statement\nContact Us\nForgot Password\nFAQ / Help Desk\nIn Store Pickup\nIn Store Services\nOrder Lookup\nRecall Information\nReturn Policy\nSame Day Delivery\nUBER Driver Rewards', 'Affiliate Program\nCareer Opportunities\nCorporate Information\nGift Cards\nInvestor Relations\n2020 Annual Report\nAnnual Meeting Materials\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets\nPress\nStore Locator', 'MyAdvance\nOnline Parts Ordering\nTechNet Professional\nTechnical Training\nInteractive Vehicle Animations\nParts & Products\nPromotions & Rewards\nShop Solutions\nFind My Mechanic', '� 2021 Advance Auto Parts Privacy Notice Terms of Use Site Map']",Yes,Yes,Steel,Beam,Black,"9mm Hook, 9x4 Hook, 3/16"" Side Lock, 7mm Bayonet, Side Pin (22mm), Side Pin (17mm), Pinch Tab, Push Button (22mm), Push Button (19mm)",Steel,16 in,Infinite,No,Universal,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,16-20inch,12058970,151,"TRICO Maxx

What was a problem, however, was the instructions. They provide pictures, but effectively no text, which makes it difficult to understand exactly how to go about installing them. They also don\'t make it clear which way the wipers should face since they have the \'spoiler\' to increase down force on the blades for a better wipe. You could argue that is common sense, but its easily something that could be mixed up or confusing for someone who isn\'t familiar with installing windshield wiper blades. One other note, these blades do have a fairly large \'profile\' The spoilers are pretty big, so they do look a bit bulky. This is fine on the Ford Flex I installed them on, but I could see them not looking too good on a smaller vehicle. If you care about aesthetics (not important, but hey, everyone has their preferences), keep this in mind. tl;dr Good blades so far, Trico needs to make better instructions.\nBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend\n0 1\nFlag this review\nYou Won\'T Be Disappointed.\nSubmitted 2 months ago\nVerified Buyer\nBefore I purchased, I checked the rating and decided to give it a try.

To install a wiper blade, lift the wiper arm away from the windshield and depress the small tab on the underside of the wiper where it meets the wiper arm.

However, we�ll install the new set of wiper blades free with purchase. 2 1\nQ\nWhat cars will these wipers fit? We bought them as a Christmas present for a 2009 Ford Fusion but she traded the car.

They replaced blades I bought less than 6 months ago at an oil-change shop that were terrible! They made a scrapping noise and didn\'t clear the rain off the windshield. when I tried to take them back, the shop said it was only because there wasn\'t sufficient rain on the windshield.

I found it easier to assemble the place to the mount clip, First, the slide and lock the clip to my vehicle. Much cheaper $$ than the dealer.

The whole process, including my blunder, took less than 2 minutes.\nBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend\n1 0\nFlag this review\nAdapters Provided With Wiper Blade Were Too Small!\nSubmitted 8 months ago\nUsing the CORRECT adapter for my 2006 Toyota RAV4, I was unable to attach the blade. Still was unable to clip on the adapter after lubricating it with WD-40 and had to shave about 1/16"" from the head of the wpier arm with a box cutter before it fit snugly. Would not buy these blades again for this reason.\nBottom Line No, I would not recommend to a friend\n1 0\nFlag this review\nI Would Buy Again\nSubmitted 9 months ago\nThe negative comments about this wiper not fitting (too tight), or, requiring filing, are a result of the reviewer NOT reading the instructions.

The blade fits perfectly and looks like a stock installation. Why not 5 stars? The instructions are awful. It is not clear how the adaptor works on the packaging. I kept fiddling with it, and it slid open, and then it was obvious how it went on. It does fit well, it went together easily once I figured it out. The pictures on the box (inside) are small, hard to see, and don't clearly show the little piece you need to slide back. I am a mechanical engineer (field support) and instruct technicians on repairs on equipment, so it is not a lacking of understanding on my part. Clear instructions would make this 5 stars. I wish they had a silicone blade option, but this wiper is good for what it is. I suspect other wipers are just as bad (in my experience, it is so), so only one ding for the instructions being unclear.

If the best regular wiper is a 6/10, these are a solid 10/10.

When I needed a new wiper blade on my new car I asked for Rain-X by brand name because they worked so well on my other vehicle. These blades are extremely efficient in clearing water from the windshield and they are very quiet. I don\'t turn on my wipers when there is no water on the windshield so I can\'t speak to that but even in a light mist they are extremely quiet. They seem a little expensive but if they last as long as advertised it is money well spent.\nBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend\n0 0\nFlag this review\nLove Rainex But Not This Silicone Version!\nSubmitted 6 months ago\nThis product is the worst, I cannot recommend it at all because it squeaks so much. One month after installing them they started to become noisy. It\'s like nails on a chalkboard. Total waste of money. Stay away from this silicone version. I have never had this problem with the rainex latitude style.\nBottom Line No, I would not recommend to a friend\n2 1\nFlag this review\nWon\'T Stay Locked In Place.\nSubmitted 7 months ago\nThese worked great until the locking mechanism kept coming loose.

Expensive on the front end, but they work as well as they did on day one and it\'s now February 2021. 2+ years and still good as new.\nBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend\n2 0\nFlag this review\nTerrible\nSubmitted 1 year ago\nThe mounting point is HUGE and ugly and it makes the wiper arm stick up much higher than other blades. I was concerned they would cause the wiper arms to smack my hood in the lowest position. They do clear just barely but that might actually be a problem for some cars. At first I thought I\'d get over seeing them sticking up all the time but I never did. Within 4 months, the plastic retainer cap at the far end of the blade just fell off in the wind which left the silicone blade sliding it\'s way out of the main piece and slapping around on my windshield like a wet noodle.

Would wiping on evrlast silicone every month on wiper blades, make them last longer. I have been told with routine maintenance of some type, a set of silicone wipers can last for 6 to 8 years, is this true?\nAdd your answer\nVerified Reply - Solomon\nHi Paul, I\'m glad to help you! The silicone wiper blade rubber material is extremely resistant to wear and damage from UV and heat exposure as well as cold temperatures. This makes them last up to twice as long as a wiper blade made from natural rubber.

The Bosch wiper blade Part No 24OE is a 24 inch blade but it does not show to be an exact fit, where the arm connects to the blade is most likely what is giving you trouble. For the same Bosch brand you would need Part No 24A http://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/bosch-beam-wiper-blade-24-24a/5070109-P this would be the 24 inch driver side blade.

After installing the new wiper blades which was very easy to do a rain storm hit the area where I live and I had to go out in it. I was very impressed with the job that my new wiper blades done during a twenty minute down pour. Very happy with my purchase so far.

Bosch ICON blades use exclusive tension spring arcing technology to create a fit that is custom-contoured to the curvature of each side of the windshield. The correct blade for a particular vehicle is based on a combination of the blade length and the curvature of the windshield. Driver side always has an ""A"" part number. Passenger side can have an ""A"" or ""B"" part number depending on the vehicle. Blades with a ""B"" part number have a greater curvature specifically designed to wrap around the passenger side window for greater visibility and clarity. Bosch continues its innovation and leadership with the ICON OE Multi-Clip connector, which offers a like-for-like OE replacement. The Multi-Clip features a flexible connector system, simplifying the installation process for all types of vehicles. 2 0\nASK A QUESTION\nShow more Q&A\nRECENTLY VIEWED AND RELATED ITEMS\n$30.99\nTRICO Maxx\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 21 Inch\n$28.99\nTRICO Maxx\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 18 Inch\n$63.99\nBosch\nOE Premium Conventional Wiper Blade Set, 23 Inch and 20 Inch', ""Exclusive dual rubber resists heat and ozone deterioration and is proven to last up to 40% longer than other premium wiper blades\nPatented beam design with shielded connector optimizes visibility, even under extreme weather conditions\nFlexible asymmetric spoiler distributes a uniform downward force along the entire blade to hold it firmly to the windshield at higher speeds\nExclusive tension spring arching technology creates a fit that's custom-contoured to the curvature of each side of the windshield\nEasy installation with original equipment-quality adapter"", '5 Stars\n213\n4 Stars\n16\n3 Stars\n9\n2 Stars\n2\n1 Star\n6', 'Brake Pads & Shoes\nBrake Rotors\nAlternators\nWater Pumps\nShow All', 'Ford Parts\nChevrolet Parts\nHonda Parts\nDodge Parts\nShow All', 'Spark Plugs\nCar Batteries\nOil Filters\nMotor Oil\nShow All', 'Manufacturer Brand\nVehicle Make / Model\nPerformance Parts\nLawn & Garden\nBoating & Marine\nMotorcycle & ATV', '', '', 'Accessibility Statement\nContact Us\nForgot Password\nFAQ / Help Desk\nIn Store Pickup\nIn Store Services\nOrder Lookup\nRecall Information\nReturn Policy\nSame Day Delivery\nUBER Driver Rewards', 'Affiliate Program\nCareer Opportunities\nCorporate Information\nGift Cards\nInvestor Relations\n2020 Annual Report\nAnnual Meeting Materials\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets\nPress\nStore Locator', 'MyAdvance\nOnline Parts Ordering\nTechNet Professional\nTechnical Training\nInteractive Vehicle Animations\nParts & Products\nPromotions & Rewards\nShop Solutions\nFind My Mechanic', '� 2021 Advance Auto Parts Privacy Notice Terms of Use Site Map']",No,NA,EPDM,Beam,NA,NA,Steel,18 in,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Black,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,16-20inch,5070099,299,"Bosch

Its the worth the price just on ease of use. They wipe perfectly and also have. Alittle sticker on them similar to what a shaving razor blade or some toothbrushes have to tell you when its time to change it out that turns yellow when its needing replacement. Prob gimmicky but non the less a nice little touch. I wouldnt hesitate to order these blades again wven if they last only 6 months. My last trico blades were a pia to install, u needed to find the letter matching piece recommended for ur style of wiper blade than attach that to the blade then attach that to the wiper and i remember it being a pain. I used a flat head screwdriver to remove them by prying them off into pieces as i couldnt even figure out how tk get em off properly. (These new bosch focus blades) are the ealxact opposite, you will realize u do not even need to read the instructions, also most times the employee will change em out for ya, but because of how crazy our world is i opted to not bother them for these and im happy i didnt as they were simple to install. I 100 percent recommend these blades to anyone considering them n i live in the northeast with cold, and hot temperatures and the westher that comes with both. They perform flawlessly thus far.\nBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend\n10 0\nFlag this review\nDisplaying Reviews 1-2\nBack to Top\nCUSTOMERS ALSO LIKED\n$30.99\nBosch\nFOCUS Premium Beam Wiper Blade, 18 Inch\n$13.99\nTRICO Rear\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 11 Inch\n$29.99\nBosch\nFOCUS Premium Beam Wiper Blade, 17 Inch\nCUSTOMER QUESTIONS & ANSWERS\nWhat do you want to know about this product?\nASK A QUESTION\nRECENTLY VIEWED AND RELATED ITEMS\n$30.99\nTRICO Maxx\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 21 Inch\n$28.99\nTRICO Maxx\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 18 Inch\n$63.99\nBosch\nOE Premium Conventional Wiper Blade Set, 23 Inch and 20 Inch', 'NightView technology creates a single core construction, fusing the blade to the base connector.

I put them on as directions said. Why is it doing this cause I can't see when there on?\nAdd your answer\nVerified Reply - Solomon\nHi Drew, I'm glad to help you! The sound of your wipers chattering away on your windshield isn't just grating, it also means the water isn't getting wiped away efficiently, you'll often see streak marks in the path of a chattering blade. There are a few possible causes of this problem. It's often the result of a buildup of wax, oil, or grease which prevents the blade from cleanly wiping the water away. However, without the presence of your vehicle we would not be able to properly diagnose it, nor provide you with a 100% answer. I would suggest that you take your vehicle and get it thoroughly checked by a certified mechanic to solve the problem. 1 2\nASK A QUESTION\nShow more Q&A\nRECENTLY VIEWED AND RELATED ITEMS\n$30.99\nTRICO Maxx\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 21 Inch\n$28.99\nTRICO Maxx\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 18 Inch\n$63.99\nBosch\nOE Premium Conventional Wiper Blade Set, 23 Inch and 20 Inch"", 'This 2-IN-1 wiper blade + rain repellent clears and repels the elements for ultimate driving visibility\nRain-X Latitude Water Repellency wiper blades apply a patented Rain-X water repellent coating to your windshield\nThe patented universal adapter is easy to use and fits 96% of vehicles - install at home in minutes\nAll-Weather Performance - the synthetic blend rubber squeegee can withstand extreme weather conditions for enhanced durability', '5 Stars\n301\n4 Stars\n35\n3 Stars\n12\n2 Stars\n3\n1 Star\n15', 'Brake Pads & Shoes\nBrake Rotors\nAlternators\nWater Pumps\nShow All', 'Ford Parts\nChevrolet Parts\nHonda Parts\nDodge Parts\nShow All', 'Spark Plugs\nCar Batteries\nOil Filters\nMotor Oil\nShow All', 'Manufacturer Brand\nVehicle Make / Model\nPerformance Parts\nLawn & Garden\nBoating & Marine\nMotorcycle & ATV', '', '', 'Accessibility Statement\nContact Us\nForgot Password\nFAQ / Help Desk\nIn Store Pickup\nIn Store Services\nOrder Lookup\nRecall Information\nReturn Policy\nSame Day Delivery\nUBER Driver Rewards', 'Affiliate Program\nCareer Opportunities\nCorporate Information\nGift Cards\nInvestor Relations\n2020 Annual Report\nAnnual Meeting Materials\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets\nPress\nStore Locator', 'MyAdvance\nOnline Parts Ordering\nTechNet Professional\nTechnical Training\nInteractive Vehicle Animations\nParts & Products\nPromotions & Rewards\nShop Solutions\nFind My Mechanic', '� 2021 Advance Auto Parts Privacy Notice Terms of Use Site Map']",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11371002,619,"Rain-X Latitude

They lasted nearly twice as long as the original wiper inserts, and don\'t \'chatter\' like most rubber blades, so when it was time for replacement, I purchased them again. And based upon his experience, when my car needed new wiper blades, I purchased a set as well. I also use Rain-X Original Glass Water Repellent and Rain-X all season washer fluid for excellent long-lasting results.\n0 0\nFlag this review\nDisplaying Reviews 1-5\nBack to Top\nNext �\nCUSTOMERS ALSO LIKED\n$25.99\n(18)\nRain-X Latitude\nWater Repellency Premium Beam Wiper Blade, 19 Inch\n$15.49\n(25)\nRain-X Weatherbeater\nPremium Conventional Wiper Blade, 28 Inch\n$13.99\nTRICO Rear\nPremium Beam Wiper Blade, 12"" Inch\nCUSTOMER QUESTIONS & ANSWERS\nQ&A\nQ\nwill these fit a 2012 chevy equinox?\nAdd your answer\nVerified Reply - Steve\nNo, Charles.
